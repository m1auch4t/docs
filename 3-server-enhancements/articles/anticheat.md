# Anticheat

> [!Info]
> Throughout this guide 'Anticheat(s)' may be referred to as 'AC' or 'ACs'

ACs are an integral part of any public server and help with catching hackers. Since Minecraft's built-in anticheat is practically useless, it's better to turn it off than to endure the constant false positives it spews out. 

You should change the following settings within the  `server.properties` file.

```yml
...

allow-flight=true

...

```

Within the `spigot.yml` file you should also set the following values.

```yml
...

     moved-wrongly-threshold: 100000.0
     moved-too-quickly-multiplier: 100000.0
     
...
```

> [!NOTE]
> The above settings within the `spigot.yml` file are not necessary if `allow-flight` is set to true.
